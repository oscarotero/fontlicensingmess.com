    Since the democratisation of digital goods, one can rarely avoid using fonts. Anyone with a computer or other electronic device interacts with fonts daily, yet almost none thinks about it. Quoting Matthew Carter, “few consumers are concerned to know where a particular typeface came from or when or who designed it, if, indeed, there was any human agency involved in its creation if it didn’t just sort of materialise out of the software ether”.

    It is a common misconception that fonts come automatically with electronic devices, without even considering they are independent products purchased and used as such. Those who obtain font licences often need clarification about the limitations of their use, and the purchase process can appear unclear and complicated sometimes. Every font has a licence, whether free, open-source, or pre-installed on a computer.
