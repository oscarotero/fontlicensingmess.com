    A social media licence allows for using a font in content created and published on social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and more.

    The font can be seen in formats such as static images or videos, although some foundries use a separate licence for video content. For advertising or paid content, a few offer another licence measured by the number of impressions.

    As in other cases, this particular use is often included in basic licences or integrated into a licence pack. Still, some foundries follow a different strategy, segregating the license to more specific uses like Social Media, Logotype, or Digital Ads.

    The pricing tiers are calculated mainly by the number of followers or subscribers across all the social media channels, starting at 10.000. The median price for a single text font in a sample of 18 foundries is 66â‚¬; a bit higher but not too far from the average price for desktop and web licences.
