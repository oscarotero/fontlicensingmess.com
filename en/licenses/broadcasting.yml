    The confusion here comes from how and where the video productions will be distributed. Some broadcasting licences include two types of video content and distribution channels: videos displayed and/or streamed in mass media, on one side, and paid advertisement, on the other side, which also includes platforms and formats such as social media or digital billboards. Some foundries differentiate broadcast content from advertising, so we need to double-check the EULA to know about rights and restrictions.

    It is interesting to note the variety of options for measuring broadcasting licences. After ‘use case’ (number of productions), we also find metrics that measure economic factors or geographic scope, such as the number of countries where the production will be seen or the budget for the project. 

    Two foundries charge an annual fee for broadcast productions. Prices range from base costs below 200€ to some of the highest licences in our database.
