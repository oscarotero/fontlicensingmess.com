    This licence is tailored to permit the use of a digital font in a logotype or a trademark. Once created, the vector or bitmap image of the logo can be used in any media (websites, printed material, packaging, advertising, signage…).

    This use is mostly included in desktop licences. The few foundries that offer a logotype licence (13) either measure the company’s size by the number of employees or ask for ‘use cases’ (number of logotypes), which can sometimes be segregated as logotype and trademark.

    The price for a single text font ranges from the lowest 29€ to the highest above 400€.
